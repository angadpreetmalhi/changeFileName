fileChanger(r"path of file where you want to make changes",
        r"here is the text file in which you can write the name of files you want to skip", "extention" )
For example fileChanger(r"C:/Users/Angadpreet/Desktop/data",
        r"C:/Users/Angadpreet/PycharmProjects/class/skipFiles.txt", ".txt" )

This code will help you to do that within seconds. You can also skip the files which you don't want to change.
